This is a WordPress plugin to display your external content is a Custom Post Type on your site. It's under development. The idea is that you could enter a URL, and then the plugin parses it and displays either the content with connonical links, or some kind of summary and a link. There will be differnt parsers for at least these types:

Quora.com (special features)
Stack Exchange (special features)
Guest Posts for writers 
SEO articles (won't duplicate content)

I just started this so if anyone wants to help let me know.
